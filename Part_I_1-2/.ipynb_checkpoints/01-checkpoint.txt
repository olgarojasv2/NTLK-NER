Missy was sitting on a chair in a house, maps and papers spread around, normally her planning was mental, but River had suggested a physical map to refer to and it was helpful. River walked out of the bedroom. “The people who own this house really have no good clothes.” She was wearing a t-shirt that drenched her form, and some trousers that looked about the right size, Missy smiled, still in her Mary Poppins looking outfit, River looked over at the maps. “Darling, wouldn’t it be better to start there?” She pointed at a place on the map. “It’s more central.” Missy smiles and leans back, placing a kiss on River’s jaw, a smile on her face, River reaches onto the table for a cup of coffee, gracefully sitting herself on the chair next to Missy, she raises the cups to her lips, wondering wether Missy had noticed yet. “That’s my cup!” River smiles, placing it down, Missy glares at her and River leans over to kiss her. The maps are still strewn over the table and Missy fixes her jacket a bit, she looks over the maps, and River points out the faults or flaws, showing her little bits to improve.

It was an hour or two later and the maps had been pushed aside, Missy was sipping at the coffee, and River was, a little less elegantly now, sitting on the chair, she moved her hands forward, towards Missy, placing it on her hearts, feeling them beat, they were faster then normal, River smiled, Missy turned to look at her. “So what should we do with the people that own this place?” River’s smile turned crooked. “The usual.”
